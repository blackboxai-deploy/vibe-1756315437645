# Snake Game Implementation Progress

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Core Structure
- [x] Create TypeScript interfaces and types for game entities
- [x] Create game utility functions for core logic
- [x] Create main SnakeGame component with HTML5 Canvas
- [x] Create main page layout with game integration

### Phase 2: Game Logic
- [x] Implement snake movement system with directional controls
- [x] Implement food generation and collision detection
- [x] Implement game state management (playing, paused, game over)
- [x] Add score tracking and high score persistence

### Phase 3: User Interface
- [x] Add control panel (Start/Pause/Restart buttons)
- [x] Add score display and game status indicators
- [x] Add instructions panel and controls guide
- [x] Style with Tailwind CSS for responsive design

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
- [x] Implement progressive difficulty scaling
- [x] Add mobile touch controls
- [x] Add keyboard event handling
- [x] Add local storage for high score persistence

### Phase 5: Testing & Polish
- [x] **AUTOMATIC**: Process placeholder images (placehold.co URLs) ‚Üí AI-generated images
  - This step executes automatically when placeholders are detected
  - No manual action required - system triggers automatically
  - Ensures all images are ready before testing
- [x] Build and test application
- [x] Test gameplay mechanics and controls
- [ ] Test mobile compatibility
- [ ] Final polish and optimizations
